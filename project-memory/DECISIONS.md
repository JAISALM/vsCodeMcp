# Project Decisions

## D001 - D128: The Legacy Foundation
- **D001-D041:** Core setup, including the **NO MUSIC (D041)** rule for all future scenes.
- **D042:** Blender MCP official setup for the director-driven workflow.
- **D060-D110:** The "Silly-Silly" and "Krea2" style-locking experiments, including the PE (Prompt Expansion) variance.
- **D111-D119:** The "Boar-Grave" blockout, the MiniMax H3 R2V pipeline, and the 5-angle camera strategy.
- **D120:** FaceRefine armor for facial consistency in long shots.
- **D121:** The Bilingual Capture route (Dictation → Manglish → Bilingual Script).
- **D122:** Disk Space Rescue (Moving models to F: drive and creating junctions to save D: drive).
- **D123-D128:** The "Writing Model" bake-off. **D128.1: HauhauCS QAT Q4_K_M confirmed as the default writer.**

## D129 — The Grave Metaphor & IQ Selection (2026-10-13)
- **The Grave:** Digging a boar grave symbolizes digging up the past. Jaisal's transition from digging (down) to rising (up) with Zidhan's help represents his journey back into the academy.
- **IQ Selection:** In the 1950 mind-trip, Jaisal picks players based on "Football IQ" (math, space, and positioning) rather than raw power.
- **Tactics vs. Physicality:** The core clash is "Tactics" (Jaisal) vs "Kaalappoott" (Zidhan). The realization: Tactics dominate the game, but Physicality wins the final.

## D130 — Cinematic Transitions & Ground Reality (2026-10-14)
- **The Coconut Tree Wipe:** A seamless transition from Jaisal's backyard to the training ground using a coconut tree as a frame-wipe.
- **The Sputtering Spray:** A detail showing the lack of resources in the academy—the first-aid spray is nearly empty, highlighting the need for tournament victory to fund the academy.
- **The "Kaalappoott" Shift:** Shift from a Red Card to a **Yellow Card + Fight** in the first half, keeping Adam in the game while showcasing the messy, physical nature of 5's football.

## D131 — Daily .md safety-commit standard (2026-10-14)
- **Decision:** All `.md` changes (project memory, docs, scripts, root) are committed to git **immediately after changing** via `utilities\commit_md.ps1`. Windows scheduled task `VsCodeMcp-MdDailyCommit` (daily **22:30**) runs it as a safety net.
- **Reason:** a session nuked `project-memory/` state + task files on 2026-10-14 (recovered from git history). The commit history is the only reliable recovery path.
- **Gitignore:** new images/media (`*.png`/`*.jpg`/`*.mp4`/`*.wav`/`*.blend`/`*.log`) are NOT committed; previously tracked images stay tracked. Do not `git add -A`.
- **What goes into git (refined 2026-10-14):** `.md` files = always (auto). **Workflow JSONs = manual, only when reusable/needed in the future** (Episode 1 ones: `episode1\workflows\`). Generated images/audio/video = never.
- **Restore recipe:** `git log --oneline -- <file>` → `git checkout <commit> -- <file>`.
- **Status:** Active. Also recorded in AGENTS.md ("Daily .md safety-commit standard").

## D132 — Writer-model boundary + resume brief (2026-10-14)
- **Decision:** the **writer model (Gemma4-31B QAT)** does creative output ONLY — it
  **never edits existing project files**; it may **create new files only** (e.g.
  `episode1\episode1_script_partN.md`). All edits to existing files (memory, decisions,
  docs, commits) are done by the **agent model (Qwen)** session or the user.
- **Resume brief:** `episode1\CONTINUE_SCRIPT.md` = the self-contained entry point for
  "continue the script" — the writer reads it, writes the ONE new file it names, touches
  nothing else. Framing rule: writer tasks are always ONE action, never multi-step
  file juggling (Gemma is weak at agentic work).
- **Reason:** makes "start a new session → 'let's continue the script'" reliable:
  AGENTS.md points to the brief; the brief carries all canon (characters, motifs,
  milestones, anchor line, NO-MUSIC rule).
- **Status:** Active. Also recorded in AGENTS.md ("Writer-model boundary").
